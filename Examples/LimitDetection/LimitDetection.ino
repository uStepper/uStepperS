*  Description:  Limit Detection Example Sketch!                                            *
*                This example demonstrates how the library can be used to detect hard       *
*                limits in an application, without the use of mechanical endstop switches.  *
*                Stallguard is very sensitive and provides seamless stall detection when 	  *
*				         tuned for the application. It is dependent on speed, current setting		    *
*				         and load conditions amongst others. The encoder stall detection is 		    *
*				         unaffected by most of these but can be a bit less sensitive.				        *
*                                                                                           *

*  Note.......:  Place the stepper motor on a solid surface where it cannot harm anyone     *
*                during the test.                                                           *
